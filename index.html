<p>Hey! Programming hardware is super fun. It lets you control LED lights, create cool burgler alarms for your stuff, make a little robot that can water your plants, or really--if you work hard enough--do almost anything with motors, sensors, lights, and more. The Arduino microcontroller (that's just fancyspeak for a programmable circuit board that can control other stuff) makes this kind of stuff super easy.
